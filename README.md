# Re_Channel
Hello, here I post a simple but very useful application. It allows you to change the desired channel of all the midi files placed in a folder, it is especially useful when we have hundreds of drums files recorded on channel 1, for example, and we want them all to be in the correct one (9). I have used Melanchall Drywetmidi's wonderful library.
